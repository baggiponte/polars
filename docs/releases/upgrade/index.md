# About

The upgrade guide is intended to help you upgrade from an older Polars version to a newer one.

For each breaking release, it contains all breaking changes that were not previously deprecated, as well as any significant new deprecations.

A full list of all changes is available in the [changelog](../changelog.md).

!!! rust "Note"

    There is no upgrade guide yet for Rust releases.
    It will be added once the rate of breaking changes to the rust API slows down and a [deprecation policy](../../development/versioning.md#deprecation-period) is added.
